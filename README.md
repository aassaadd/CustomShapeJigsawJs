#CustomShapeJigsawJs

This is a (pretty broken, but mostly functional) jigsaw generator with custom border support.
It relies on two linbraries from third parties, imagetracerjs and flatten (see respective files) and it also leverages the tab generator from the jigsaw generator by draradech (https://draradech.github.io/jigsaw/index.html)
Use online at https://proceduraljigsaw.github.io/CustomShapeJigsawJs/ and read the help there for more information
